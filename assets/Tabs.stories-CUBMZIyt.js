Tabs organise and allow users to move between content without having to navigate away from a page.

## When to use

Use tabs when you are organisazing related content in a single cointainer or need to flip between multiple panes or sections. It’s a way to group content, connect related information, and is used as a tool to save space.

## Alternatives and related components

Use anchor navigation on longer pages with multiple sub-headings when you don’t group the content into groups.

## Anatomy

Tabs consists of:

1. Label: describes the content contained within it.
2. Line: this line shows the state of a tab
3. Trailing icon: this icon shows that it is possible to view all tabs that are not visible on the screen
4. Container

## (Interactive) states

Tabs contains the states active, inactive, hover, disabled and focus.

## Design properties

### Typography

- Label inactive: TheSans/md/400
- Label active: TheSans/md/700

### Color

- Label inactive: text color Grey/4
- Label active: text color Blue/3
- Line inactive: fill color Grey/2
- Line active: fill color Blue/3

### Interactive states

- Hover inactive: label color Blue/3, line color Grey/2
- Disabled: label color Grey/2, line color Grey/2
- Focus: border color Ocher/5, line color Grey/2

### Structure

- Label: padding-top and padding bottom 8px, padding-left and padding-right 16px
- Line: width 2px, padding-top 8px
- Trailing icon: size 16px, padding-left 4px

#### Mobile

- Label (and trailing icon): centered

## Accessibility

- Tab, shift + tab - to move focus between tabs.
- Space or Enter - to display the selected tab's content

## Content guidelines

Order the tabs by priority or importance from left to right

### Labels

- Each tab label needs to describe the content contained within it.
- Keep tab labels short and meaningful. Between 1-2 words is best and written in plain language. Keep in mind that at mobile widths and during translation, the character length of a label will impact the experience.
- Ensure that each tab label is unique.
- Do not use icons in tab labels.
- Tab labels shouldn't be longer than one or two words and be accurate in their description.
- Tab labels should also make sense when read in isolation.
- Never truncate tab labels. If a label overruns the container, find a shorter alternative.
- Do use title case for tab labels.

## Best practices

### Dos

Tabs should:

- As a default, there must always be one tab that's already selected and the content panel below it must be visible.
- Always be placed above the content it relates to.
- Have a minimum number of 2 tabs.
- Only one content panel can be shown at a time.
- Have the same font size for the label text of each tab
- Have one line of text for labels.
- Have an order that should be consistent across an experience. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.

### Don’ts

Tabs should:

- Not be putted underneath the content it relates to.
- The order of the tabs from left to right should never change. Only the content panel should change.
- Not use two lines of text for labels.
- Not use no more than six tabs in most scenarios. This maintains an uncluttered UI and reduces cognitive load for users.
- Not be used for primary navigation.

### Behavior

- The first tab section is selected by default
- Only one tab can be selected at a time
- Currently selected tab is always highlighted
- Tabs are scrollable by default and do not wrap to a second line
