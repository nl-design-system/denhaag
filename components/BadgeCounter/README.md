Counter badges are used to indicate that there is a notification and display the number of notifications. It is an
update message that announces something new for the user to see. Badges are typically used to indicate a new message.

## Best practices

### Do's

Badges should:

- Be hidden when count is 0
- Have a maximal count of 999. Once you reach higher than 999, the label becomes "999+".
- Be used for counts of important information, close to the relevant item.
- Notify or draw attention to changed values or states
- Be used when there is an underlying message in the menu
- Be used sparingly

### Don'ts

Dot indicators should:

- Not be used if you need a text label. Use `Tag` instead.
