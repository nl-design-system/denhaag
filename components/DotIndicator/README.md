## Best practices

### Do's

Dot indicators should:

- Notify the user that something is new or updated without showing a count, such as an "unread message", or activity notification
- Notify or draw attention to changed values or states
- Be used when there is an underlying message in the menu
- Be used sparingly

### Don'ts

Dot indicators should:

- Not be used if you need to display a count. Use `Badge counter` instead.
